# Current Feature: UI Polish and pnpm 11 Cleanup

Remove repeated onboarding guidance, add pointer cursors to shared buttons, and migrate the dependency build allowlist to pnpm 11 settings.

Ready to Commit

## Goal

Users get clearer onboarding copy and expected pointer feedback on buttons, while contributors can run pnpm commands without the obsolete-settings warning.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `/onboarding/next-step` shows “Choose one action you can make progress on in your next session.” exactly once, as the Next step input helper text.
- [x] The heading, Journey context, input, validation, actions, and responsive layout remain unchanged.
- [x] All clickable controls built from the shared `Button` primitive use Tailwind's `cursor-pointer` utility; existing directly rendered clickable buttons retain the same cursor behavior.
- [x] pnpm 11 reads the approved dependency build allowlist from `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, preserving approval for `esbuild` and `lightningcss` without the ignored `package.json#pnpm` warning.

## Plan

1. Remove the redundant introductory copy above the Next step form while retaining the helper copy below the input.
2. Tighten the focused rendering test to assert that the required guidance appears exactly once.
3. Add Tailwind's `cursor-pointer` utility to the shared `Button` primitive and confirm all production raw buttons already handle clickable cursor state.
4. Replace the removed `package.json#pnpm.onlyBuiltDependencies` field with pnpm 11's `allowBuilds` setting in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`.
5. Run the full verification baseline because dependency build configuration changed, then confirm the affected screen and computed button cursor in a browser.

## Verification

- [x] `pnpm check` passes
- [x] `pnpm test` passes
- [x] `pnpm build` passes
- [x] Affected UI verified in the browser, if applicable
- [x] Mobile and desktop verified, if responsive UI changed
- [x] No relevant console errors
- [x] Focused Next step component test passes
- [x] Required guidance appears exactly once in the rendered screen
- [x] Shared clickable buttons compute to `cursor: pointer` in the browser
- [x] `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` passes without the ignored `package.json#pnpm` warning

## Notes

<!-- Record important decisions, blockers, scope changes, or follow-up work. -->

- User feedback identifies the identical sentence above and below the input as redundant.
- Retain the sentence below the input because the feature specification explicitly requires it as helper copy.
- Production button inspection found that standard controls use `src/components/ui/button.tsx`; the only directly rendered application button is the selectable Pomodoro block, which already applies `cursor-pointer` when clickable.
- pnpm 11 removed `onlyBuiltDependencies` in favor of the `allowBuilds` map in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`; `esbuild` and `lightningcss` remain explicitly allowed.
- This fix does not change validation, persistence, navigation, data models, or dependency versions.
- Initial verification passed: `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, `pnpm check` (84 files), `pnpm test` (9 files, 52 tests), `pnpm build` (client and SSR), and `git diff --check`.
- Production-browser verification passed at desktop and 320×568 mobile widths: the guidance rendered exactly once, the shared Start and Back buttons exposed pointer cursors, the page had no horizontal overflow, and the console had no errors or warnings.
